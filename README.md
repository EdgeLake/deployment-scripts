# Deployment Scripts 

The following provides the default deployment process and sample scripts for AnyLog & EdgeLake.

## Node Deployment

By default, a pre-built AnyLog/EdgeLake deployment utilizes the [node-deployment](node-deployment) script to associate 
the node with a network and specify the node type.


### Process 
1. **Create Work Directories**: Set up directories for AnyLog/EdgeLake usage.
2. **Load Configuration**: Import environment configurations into the new node.
3. **Set Default Connections**: Establish default TCP, REST, and broker connections if specified.
4. **Blockchain Sync**: For non-master nodes, sync with the blockchain.

Once step 5 is executed, the generated policy triggers steps 6-11:

5. **Create Configuration Policy**: Generate a [configuration policy](node-deployment/policies/config_policy.al).
6. **Create Node Policy**: Generate a [node policy](node-deployment/policies/create_node_policy.al).
7. **Deploy Databases**: Initialize and deploy the necessary databases.
8. **Start Scheduling Processes**: Activate any scheduling processes.
9. **Enable Node Processes**: For publisher and operator nodes, enable the relevant processes.
10. **Run Additional Services**: Start services such as MQTT, node monitoring, and custom scripts.
11. **Enable License Key**: For AnyLog, enable the [license key](https://anylog.co/download-anylog/).
